# Project-1-HangMan
I tried to create a well known game called Hangman. Used Html, css and javascript,most of was css and javascript.Got success to execute most part of it. Did lot research on the game and came up with few ideas.
When collecting requirements, came up with few designs. But while I was implementing codes, which took half of my life, only one design was perfect for my project. 
It's running smooth for now but need more changes, also need to add scoreboard and timer for the game.

# User Story :

1.As a user, if i click on start button, I should see the game page.

2.As a user, clicking Play again button, should give me random line or word to play with.

3.As a user, choosing the right letters and finding out the correct answer should make me winner.

4.As a user, I should be able to track number of lives left while playing.

5.As a user, I should be able to see the animation of hangman on screen as I play along.

6.While playing I should get notice of winning  and loosing results.

# Unsolved problems:
* Working on setting timer for game, need to fix some code to execute it.
